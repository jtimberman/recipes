# Fluffy Pancakes

* 220g GF flour
* 1 Tbsp baking powder
* 1 Tbsp milk powder
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 cup milk
* 60g brown sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* ¼ cup butter, melted and cooled
* 3 eggs

Preheat griddle to 250°.

Combine flour, baking powder, milk powder, and salt.

Mix together milk, brown sugar, and vanilla.

Whisk together eggs and melted butter.

Add milk mixture and egg mixture to dry ingredients. Beat until smooth.

Spray griddle with nonstick spray. Pour ¼ cup spoonfuls of batter onto griddle. Leave room between pancakes; batter is thick, but will spread a little.

Cook as normal. Spray griddle between each set of pancakes.
