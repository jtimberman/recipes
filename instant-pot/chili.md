This recipe is for my Texas-style chili. I've made this chili in slight variations for about 15 years. It yields a good amount for dinner plus leftovers, or to bring to parties/potlucks.

## Equipment

- Instant Pot
- Cast iron pan

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds ground meat (beef, pork, buffalo, whatever you dig)
- 2 large bell peppers (red, green, yellow, etc)
- 1 Anaheim pepper
- 1 Poblano pepper
- 1 Onion or 2 large shallots
- 2 15 oz cans of tomato sauce
- 3 cups of water
- Cooking oil - I use Avocado because it has neutral flavor and high smoke point, Olive is fine too
- Spices: cumin, chili powder, black pepper, salt, smoked paprika, oregano - amounts vary, see directions

Additional spices to taste: cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander

## Directions

Set the Instant Pot to saute. Preheat the cast-iron pan with a light layer of oil.

Season the ground meat with 1-2 teaspons of each spice listed. I never really measure this, I want a good mix of spices with the ground meat. Put the meat into the Instant Pot bowl and stir ocassionally until it is brown throughout.

While the meat is sauteing, prepare the veggies. I roughly chop them into bite size pieces. Then, toss the onion with a bit of oil, salt, chili powder, and black pepper - approximately a half teaspoon of each. Then cook the onion in the cast iron. The idea is to soften it and get some nice flavor cooked in but not quite carmelize it.

Finish chopping the rest of the peppers, then toss them with chili powder, black pepper, and salt. Add them to the pan with the onions for a couple minutes.

The meat will probably be done at this point. Don't drain it - that fat that cooked off is full of flavor. Set the Instant Pot to "slow cook". Add the peppers and onions, then add the tomato sauce and water. Stir thoroughly. Add more spices to your personal tastes, then let it slow cook for approximately 6-8 hours.

Serve with sharp cheddar cheese or other garnishments that you like. Even better, bake some corn bread (recipe coming to this repo soon!), and pour a ladle-full of the chili over the bread. This is a delightful filling and nutritious meal!
